This level **extends Level 3** by supporting function calls (including recursion). In this level, we have multiple functions. Besides, the functions may take arguments and may return results. For simplicity, we assume that function calls do not appear as operands in expression; this requirement is met by first assigning the result of a function call to a source variable and then using the source variable as an operand in the expression at the required place.
